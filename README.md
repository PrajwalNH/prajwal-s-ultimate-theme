# Prajwal's Ultimate Theme
## About this theme
Hello, I am a young innovator and programmer named Prajwal NH. I have been using the VS Code default theme for a long time. However, one fine day I saw a theme that struck my eye. It was the theme that Hitesh Choudhary Sir used in his tutorials. I loved it and tried finding the same in the marketplace. Sadly, I was not able to find a theme like his. I didn't let this stop me. I went on to create my own theme inspired from Hitesh Sir. Here it is!  

> Theme: Dark  
> Code: bright and colourful!
